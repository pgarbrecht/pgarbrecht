  <p>I'm a software engineer who loves solving problems to help people. I fell in love with coding through web development, working professionally on websites for the last 5 years. Through my education I've expanded my skillset to include MERN stack and programming languages including Java, Python, C and C++. My career goal is to work as a Fullstack Software Engineer utilizing any of my existing skills and build new ones.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I love working on childrens educational apps and media for my business Family Gains. Once our products get a little further along I'll add links here so give me a follow to stay in the loop.
