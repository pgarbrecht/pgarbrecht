  <p>I'm a software engineer who loves solving problems to help people. I fell in love with coding through web development, working professionally on websites for the last 5 years. Through my education I've expanded my skillset to include MERN stack and programming languages including Java, Python, C and C++. My career goal is to work as a fullstack software engineer utilizing any of my existing skills and build new ones. In my free time, I love working on childrens educational apps and media for my business Family Gains.</p>
