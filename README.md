  <p>I'm a software engineer who loves solving problems that help people. I fell in love with coding through web development, working professionally on websites for the last 5 years. Through my education I've developed strong skills in programming languages including Java, Python, C and C++. My career goal is to work as a Fullstack Software Engineer and in my free time I love working on my own educational childrens apps for my business Family Gains. If you'd like to learn more or work together, feel welcome to reach me at philgarbrecht@gmail.com or add me on Linkedin. Happy coding! ~Phil
