  <p>I'm a software engineer who loves solving problems that help people. I fell in love with coding through web development, working professionally on websites for the last 5 years. Through my education I've expanded my webdev skillset to include MERN stack and developed strong skills in programming languages including Java, Python, C and C++. My career goal is to work as a Fullstack Software Engineer utilizing any of my existing skills (and build new ones)! In my free time, I love working on my own educational childrens apps for my business Family Gains. Once they get a little further along I'll be sure to add them here. If you'd like to learn more or work together, feel welcome to reach me at philgarbrecht@gmail.com or add me on Linkedin. Happy coding! ~Phil
